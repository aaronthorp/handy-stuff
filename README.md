Handy scripts and stuff that I use regularly

* `gitup <origin>` - Add all files, remove any deleted, get commit desc and push
* `mrtdep` - Deploy Meteor.js project to `/var/node/<foldername>`. Required `nginx.conf` and `init.conf` files in project folder to work.
 
place them in `~/bin`

add a following line to your `~/.bash_profile` file.

```
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
```
